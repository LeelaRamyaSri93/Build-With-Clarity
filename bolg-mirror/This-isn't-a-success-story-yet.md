Hey there! I’m Ramya—an undergraduate in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, steadily navigating my way into cloud-native data engineering.

This blog isn’t a portfolio of finished projects or polished achievements.  
It’s a record of the building phase—the hours spent understanding concepts, breaking things, fixing them, and occasionally just staring at code until something clicks.

I chose this path not for shiny titles, but for the invisible architecture behind great systems:  
the pipelines, the orchestration, the quiet backbone of real-time data.  
These are the things that keep me curious.

### 🔍 What I’m Currently Exploring

- Designing cloud-native workflows  
- Learning tools like Apache Airflow, Python, and Spark  
- Documenting insights and challenges openly, as I learn

Writing is how I make sense of what I’m learning.  
If you're somewhere in that messy middle of learning, building, doubting, repeating… welcome. You’re not alone.

This isn’t a success story.  
But it’s mine.  
And it’s unfolding—one step, one post, one pipeline at a time.
