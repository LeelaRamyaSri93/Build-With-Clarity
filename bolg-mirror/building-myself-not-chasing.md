### 🌱 Why I’m Writing This

This isn’t a portfolio piece.  
This isn’t a checklist to land a job.  
This is me, choosing to grow intentionally, publicly, and without shortcuts.

Real progress doesn’t come from chasing outcomes.  
It comes from building systems, solving problems, and staying curious.  
So I created a 6-month learning plan to deepen my understanding of tools and workflows that shape how I think, build, and solve.

This blog marks the beginning of that journey.

### 🧭 My 3-Phase Learning Plan

I’ve split my learning into three phases — each one designed to build depth, not just breadth.

#### 🔧 Phase 1: Foundation (Aug – Mid Sep)
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Java, Scala  
- **Systems**: Linux (Ubuntu), Bash scripting  
- **Cloud Basics**: IAM, EC2, S3  
- **Focus**: Comfort with scripting, querying, and managing environments

#### 🔄 Phase 2: Core Workflows (Mid Sep – Early Dec)
- **Data Extraction**: APIs, web scraping, Selenium  
- **Data Ingestion**: Kafka, Spark, Flink  
- **Orchestration**: Airflow, dbt  
- **Focus**: Understand how data moves, transforms, and gets scheduled

#### 🚀 Phase 3: Production-Ready Skills (Mid Dec – Feb)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes  
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions  
- **Warehousing**: Snowflake  
- **Focus**: Build scalable, deployable, and automated workflows

### 🧠 Why This Matters to Me

I’m not trying to master every tool.  
I’m trying to understand how they fit together.  
I want to build something end-to-end — from raw data to insight, from script to system.  
And I want to do it in a way that feels authentic, not performative.

This blog is my way of staying accountable, reflecting on what I learn, and connecting with others who are building themselves too.

### 💬 What’s Next

I’ll be sharing weekly updates, mini-projects, and reflections — not just the polished stuff, but the messy middle too.

If you’re on a similar path, let’s connect. Let’s learn out loud.  
Drop a comment if you’re building yourself too — I’d love to learn from your journey.
