## Week 5 Reflection (Day 19 to Day 23)

This week felt like stepping into the architect’s seat. I wasn’t just executing commands I was designing systems, debugging flows, and making decisions that shaped outcomes. The tools became familiar, but the mindset matured.

### 🐧 Linux: From Commands to Control

I moved beyond surface-level usage and started thinking like a system admin.  
Each day layered new responsibilities from managing users to securing ports.

**What I learned:**
- How to monitor system health using `df`, `du`, `free`, and `vmstat` not just to observe, but to act.
- Writing shell scripts that respond to conditions, handle errors, and automate tasks.  
- Using `awk`, `sed`, and `grep` to transform raw text into structured insights.
- Networking tools (`ping`, `curl`, `rsync`) helped me trace connectivity issues and validate setups.
- Docker gave me a glimpse into containerized workflows lightweight, isolated, and powerful.

### ☁️ AWS: From Console to Strategy

Cloud concepts started to feel intuitive. I wasn’t just launching services I was thinking about lifecycle, access, and automation.

**What I learned:**

> "Each day’s log captured not just *what* I did, but *why* it mattered."

- My AWS notes evolved into mini playbooks: EC2 setup steps, Lambda triggers, S3 lifecycle configs.

## 🧩 What Changed

- I started thinking in workflows how Linux scripts and AWS services can work together.
- I realized that good documentation is a form of storytelling. It helps others (and future me) understand the journey, not just the destination.
