## Week 2 Reflection (Day 05 to Day 08)

Week 2 felt like stepping into deeper waters with more confidence, more curiosity, and more control.

Linux became less about syntax and more about systems. I practiced changing permissions, managing processes, and connecting remotely via SSH. Each command was no longer just a tool it was part of a workflow I was beginning to own.

AWS IAM concepts matured from theory to practice. I created policies, attached them to users, and enabled MFA. Security wasn’t just something I read about it was something I implemented, tested, and trusted.

Toward the end of the week, I began exploring SQL. I won’t reflect on it deeply here that’s for Week 3. But I will say: the shift from infrastructure to data felt natural. It was time.

- I grouped commands by purpose.  
- I practiced with clarity.

This week taught me how to define boundaries technically.
