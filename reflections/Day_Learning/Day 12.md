## 🌱 Reflection
> “Some queries made me pause—not because they were hard, but because they made me think differently.”

I found myself staring at the screen, wondering how to express behavior in SQL. Once the queries worked, I was surprised—was that all it took? The logic was deep, but the syntax was elegant. Today reminded me that insight often hides behind simplicity.
