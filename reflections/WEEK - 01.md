# Week 0 Reflection

This marks the beginning of something I’ve been quietly building toward—my space to document, reflect, and grow with clarity.

I’ve always believed that learning isn’t just about collecting skills; it’s about understanding how I think, how I build, and how I evolve. This repository is my way of tracing that process—layer by layer, week by week.

Right now, I’m diving deeper into system engineering and building habits around consistent, intentional learning. I don’t have all the answers, but I do have questions—and that’s where the real growth begins.

This space will change as I do. And I’m here for it.
